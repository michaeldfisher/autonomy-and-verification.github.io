The Trustworthy Robotic Assistants project links Bristol Robotics Laboratory, the University of Bristol, the University of Hertfordshire, the University of Liverpool and the University of the West of England, with several industrial partners. The project aims to tackle the challenges of safety verification for human-robot interaction; by combining formal verification, simulation-based testing, and formative user evaluation.
